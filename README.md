# Hit Finder .DMG

This is the installer for Hit Finder, actually under development.

Hit Finder is a macOS Electron-React-Python app to organize samples and filter them by tone/tempo/tags and drag and drop them directly on a DAW

In v.0.1.20 I have integrated Spotify's Pedalboard, so now you can load your own VST3 Plugins, in future features you'll be able to create **Variants** of your own samples and drop them directly on your DAW, what could save tons of time of adjusting every sample on a professional music production workflow.

I'm developing this app with the Lean Startup framework, so I'm delivering installables for the application to early adopters who kindly help me in build something actually usefull for music producers.

Coming Features:

- Code Sign and Apple Notarize (to avoid annoying messages when installing the app)

- Pedalboard integration to use your own plugins with the app

- Schemas for Plugins chains and parameters so you could share your config to other users

- Firebase integration to share DDBB
